			<h3>UI Designer for Gabe Shabazian</h3>
			<p>I took the OS X widget, Percount, that Gabe Shabazian had made and created a design that was suitable as an iOS app. This involved significantly redesigning the interface to include features that made good use of what iOS has to offer such as MapKit. The app was called <a href="../portfolio/epoch.html" target="_blank">Epoch</a> and was available on the App Store during 2010.</p>
