	<h2>HIT THE GROUND SPRINTING</h2>
	<p>The scope of this project required pulling together a team of designers and developers to work on the many facets. My role was Interface Designer and worked collaboratively to come up with novel solutions and oversee implementation.</p>
	<p>An agile approach was chosen as this allowed the app, website, totem, and CMS top be worked on in tandem.</p>

		<p>A baseline grid was introduced to keep a visual rhythm to the design as well as keeping consistency with the other platforms.</p>

	<p>Eastland was only the beginning. The Eastland app is a template for the other shopping centres in QIC’s portfolio. This required taking each centre’s branding and applying it appropriately to the wireframes.</p>
