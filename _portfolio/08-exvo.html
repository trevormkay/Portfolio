	<h2>LIVE LIFE IN THE CLOUD</h2>
	<p class="description">Exvoâ€™s goal was simple: live life in the cloud. No matter where you are in the world, all the stuff you care about the most could be accessed from any device.</p>

		<h2>FROM CIRRUS TO STRATUS</h2>
		<p class="description">A suite of web apps was developed for a cloud OS platform. These included specialised interfaces for all your media. Because everything was in the cloud, you had no need for local storage, just stream it all.</p>

	<h2>FORMING A WHOLE SYSTEM</h2>
	<p class="description">The seed of this project was a UI library. Creating a set of themes from the start was important in insuring consistency throughout the app.</p>
	<p class="description">Interactive prototypes played an integral roll in the design of these interfaces. It allowed me to show the developers exactly how I wanted interactions to perform.</p>
	<p class="description">Icons were required throughout the interfaces which led me to creating a suite 
of 140 icons. This suite included multiple resolutions for use within the apps themselves as well as marketing.</p>
