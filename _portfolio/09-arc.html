	<h2>MAKING THE ABSTRACT SIMPLE</h2>
	<p class="description">As ARC gained additional features, to maintain and enhance usability, new and easy to understand icons were needed. The app and toolbar icons were designed to feel right at home on Yosemite, the working environment for the users at the time. For the app icon a radar motif was chosen as the metaphor to reflect searching for bugs.</p>
