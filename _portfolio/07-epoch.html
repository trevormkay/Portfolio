	<h2>MAKE MY WIDGET GROW</h2>
	<p class="description">Epoch started out life as a widget for Mac OS X called Percount, developed by Gabe Shabazian. Gabe was looking to take that widget and make it a native iPhone app.</p>

		<h2>PERCOUNT GROWS UP</h2>
		<p class="description">Bringing Percount to the iPhone meant taking full advantage of the beautiful screen and hardware. Not only was the interface of Percount scaled up, it became iOS appropriate by using a card based design to swipe through all your countdowns.</p>
		<p class="description">Location pinning was another feature made available to us based on the hardware of the iPhone. It was a defining feature that other countdown apps did not have.</p>

	<p class="type">The Process</p>
	<h2>GOING NATIVE</h2>
	<p class="description">The brief for Epoch was to use the card based layout of the original iPhone Weather app. Cards worked really well for Epoch, it allowed for multiple countdowns while making full use of the screen for user images.</p>
	<p class="quote">A period of time in history or a person's life, typically one marked by notable events</p>
	<p class="description">Transitioning to the App Store I felt like Percount needed a more appropriate name. Something that was easy to search and stood out amongst itsâ€™ contemporaries. Epoch was a perfect fit.</p>
