	<h2>HIT THE GROUND SPRINTING</h2>
	<p class="description">The scope of this project required pulling together a team of designers and developers to work on the many facets. My role was Interface Designer and worked collaboratively to come up with novel solutions and oversee implementation.</p>
	<p class="description">An agile approach was chosen as this allowed the app, website, totem, and CMS top be worked on in tandem.</p>
	<p class="description">A baseline grid was introduced to keep a visual rhythm to the design as well as keeping consistency with the other platforms.</p>
